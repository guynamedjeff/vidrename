Description:

VidRename is a python-based portfolio project by entry-level
full stack developer Jeff Roszkowski. The program is built
to change a folder's media files, specifically '.mp4', '.avi',
and '.mkv', into a more uniform format.

Currently, the user chooses this folder by naming it in the
core file of 'rename.py' through the global variable 'directory'.

Examples:

'rEd tEsT 720p 2012 gobble gobble.mp4' => 'Red.Test.2012.720p.mp4'
'gold test s01e07 fork test garbage.avi' => 'Gold.Test.S01E07.avi'
'run.mp4' => 'Run.mp4'
